## Pymakr Plugins <a id="pymakr-plugins"></a>

To make it as easy as possible Pycom has developed a plugin for two popular text editors, called Pymakr. These plugins have been built and are available for the following platforms:

- {{% refname "/pymakr/installation/atom" %}}

- {{% refname "/pymakr/installation/vscode" %}}
