In addition to the Expansion Board, Pycom also offers three additional sensor boards, which are ideal for quickly building a fully functioning IoT solution! Whether the application is environment sensing or asset tracking, these additional boards support a variety of sensors.

## Pytrack

Pytrack is a location enabled version of the Expansion Board, intended for use in GPS applications such as asset tracking or monitoring.

### Features & Hardware

The Pytrack is has a number of features including GPS, 3-Axis Accelerometer and Battery Charger. See the list below for detailed specifics about each sensor, including datasheets.

* Serial USB
* 3-Axis Accelerometer ([LIS2HH12](apireference/pytrack.md#3-axis-accelerometer-lis-2-hh-12))
* Battery Charger (BQ24040 with JST connector)
* GPS and GLONASS ([L76-L](apireference/pytrack.md#gps-with-glonass-quectel-l-76-l-gnss))
* MicroSD Card Reader

All of the included sensors are connected to the Pycom device via the I2C interface. These pins are located at `P22` (SDA) and `P21` (SCL).
