 Please Note: We have removed the labels from the pictures in the documentation due to inconsistencies with label orientation.  *The LED must be aligned above the USB socket* when inserting or removing a development board from an expansion board/Pytrack/Pysense/Pyscan.

## Differences from WiPy 2.0

* Deep sleep current draw fixed, now only 19.7ÂµA
* Upgraded RAM from 512KB to 4MB
* Upgraded External FLASH from 4MB to 8MB
* Antenna select pin moved from GPIO16 to GPIO21 (P12)

## Notes

### WiFi

By default, upon boot the WiPy3 will create a WiFi access point with the SSID `wipy-wlan-XXXX`, where `XXXX` is a random 4-digit number, and the password `www.pycom.io`.

The RF switch that selects between the on-board and external antenna is connected to `P12`, for this reason using `P12` should be avoided unless WiFi is disabled in your application.

### Power

The `Vin` pin on the WiPy3 can be supplied with a voltage ranging from `3.5v` to `5.5v`. The `3.3v` pin on the other hand is output **only**, and must not be used to feed power into the WiPy3, otherwise the on-board regulator will be damaged.

## Tutorials
