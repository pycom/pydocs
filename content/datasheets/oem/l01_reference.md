The L01 OEM reference board is a reference design suitable L01 as well as W01 making it possible to have a single PCB design that can accommodate both OEM modules.

{{% hint style="info" %}}
If you require a reference board for the L04 or G01, this design is **not** suitable as it does not feature a SIM slot or the double antenna connection. For the G01 or L04 please use the [Universal OEM Baseboard Reference](../universal_reference)
