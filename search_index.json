It should firmly click into place and the pins should now no longer be visible.\n\nBefore connecting your module to an Expansion Board 3.0, you should update the firmware on the Expansion Board 3.0. Instructions on how to do this can be found here.\n\nLook for the reset button on the module (located at a corner of the board, next to the LED).\n\nLocate the USB connector on the expansion board.\n\nInsert the LoPy module on the Expansion Board with the reset button pointing towards the USB connector. It should firmly click into place and the pins should now no longer be visible.\n\nBefore connecting your module to a Pysense/Pytrack/Pyscan board, you should update the firmware on the Pysense/Pytrack/Pyscan. Instructions on how to do this can be found here.\n\nLook for the reset button on the LoPy module (located at a corner of the board, next to the LED).\n\nLocate the USB connector on the Pysense/Pytrack/Pyscan.\n\nInsert the module on the Pysense/Pytrack/Pyscan with the reset button pointing towards the USB connector. It should firmly click into place and the pins should now no longer be visible. \n\nFirstly you will need to connect power to your LoPy. You will need to supply 3.5v-5.5v to the Vin pin.\n\nDo not feed 3.3v directly to the 3.3v supply pin, this will damage the regulator.The connect the RX and TX of your USB UART to the TX and RX of the LoPy respectively.\n\nPlease ensure you have the signal level of the UART adapter set to 3.3v before connecting it.In order to put the LoPy into bootloader mode to update the device firmware you will need to connect P2 to GND. We recommend you connect a button between the two to make this simpler.\n\nNote: This method of connection is not recommended for first time users. It is possible to lock yourself out of the device, requiring a USB connection.In order to access the LoPy via WiFi you only need to provide 3.5v - 5.5v on the Vin pin of the LoPy:\n\nBy default, when the LoPy boots, it will create a WiFi access point with the following credentials:\nSSID: lopy-wlan\n\npassword: www.pycom.io\n\n\nOnce connected to this network you will be able to access the telnet and FTP servers running on the LoPy. For both of these the login details are:\nusername: micro\n\npassword: python\n\n\n\nAntennas\nLora\nIf you intend on using the LoRa connectivity of the LoPy you must connect a LoRa antenna to your LoPy before trying to use LoRa otherwise you risk damaging the device.\n\nThe LoPy only supports LoRa on the 868MHz or 915MHz bands. It does not support 433MHz. For this you will require a LoPy4.\n\n\nFirstly you will need to connect the U.FL to SMA pig tail to the LoPy using the U.FL connector on the same side of the LoPy as the LED.\n\n\n\nIf you are using a pycase, you will next need to put the SMA connector through the antenna hole, ensuring you align the flat edge correctly, and screw down the connector using the provided nut.\nFinally you will need to screw on the antenna to the SMA connector.\n\n\nWiFi/Bluetooth (optional)\nAll Pycom modules, including the LoPy, come with a on-board WiFi antenna as well as a U.FL connector for an external antenna. The external antenna is optional and only required if you need better performance or are mounting the LoPy in such a way that the WiFi signal is blocked. Switching between the antennas is done via software, instructions for this can be found here.\n\nDeep Sleep current issue\nThe LoPy, SiPy, and WiPy 2.0 experience an issue where the modules maintain a high current consumption in deep sleep mode.

This is not meant as a comprehensive guide to MicroPython programming but rather a reference to those who already know programming. If you are new to python, or programming all together, we highly recommend searching the internet for Python tutorials. There are many very good tutorials available for free and the skills you learn will be easily transferable to our platform.\nYour first Pymakr project: Once you understand what MicroPython is, this guide will take you through setting up your first Pymakr project to blink the on-board RGB LED. This guide will explain the structure of a MicroPython project as well as how to upload it to your module.\n\nOnce you are familiar with MicroPython and Pymakr, the recommended way of uploading code to your module, you can explore the pages below. These will discuss in greater detail the various mechanisms for running code on your device as well as how to recover it if something goes wrong.\n\nREPL: The REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop) is an interactive terminal that allows you to type in and test your code directly on the device, just like interactive python interpreter. It can be accessed via UART or Telnet. This is accessed easiest by using Pymakr but if you wish to use other tools, this page will explain how.\nFTP: All Pycom modules start up with a WiFi access point enabled, and a simple FTP server running on it. Once connected to the WiFi network, you can use FTP to transfer files over to your device wirelessly. This can be very useful if you do not have physical access to your device.\nSafe Boot: It is possible that some code you upload to your module will prevent you accessing the REPL or FTP server, preventing you from updating your scripts. This guide will detail how to safe boot your module and how to remove the offending scripts from it.\n\n"},"gettingstarted/programming/micropython.html":{"url":"gettingstarted/programming/micropython.html","title":"Introduction to MicroPython","keywords":"","body":"Introduction to MicroPython\nOur boards work with MicroPython; a Python 3.5 implementation that is optimised to run on micro controllers. This allows for much faster and more simple development process than using C.\n\nBooting into MicroPython\nWhen booting, two files are executed automatically: first boot.py and then main.py. These are placed in the /flash folder on the board. Any other files or libraries can be placed here as well, and can be included or used from boot.py or main.py.\nThe folder structure in /flash looks like the picture below. The files can be managed either using FTP or using the Pymakr Plugin.\n\nTips & Tricks\nMicropython shares majority of the same syntax as Python 3.5. The intention of this design is to provide compatibility upwards from Micropython to Python 3.5, meaning that code written for Micropython should work in a similar manner in Python 3.5. There are some minor variations and these should taken viewed as implementation differences.\nMicropython also has a number of Micropython specific libraries for accessing hardware level features. Specifics relating to those libraries can be found in the Firmware API Reference section of this documentation.\nMicropython, unlike C/C++ or Arduino, does not use braces {} to indicate blocks of code specified for class and function definitions or flow control. Blocks of code are denoted by line indentation, which is strictly enforced.\nThe number of spaces in the indentation is variable but all statements within a block must be indented the same amount.\n\n"},"gettingstarted/programming/examples.html":{"url":"gettingstarted/programming/examples.html","title":"MicroPython Examples","keywords":"","body":"MicroPython Examples\nTo get you started with Python (MicroPython) syntax, we've provided you with a number of code examples.\nVariable Assignment\nAs with Python 3.5, variables can be assigned to and referenced.

The example below shows how a temperature sensor might be implemented in code.\ntemperature = 15\ntarget = 10\nif temperature > target:\n    print(\"Too High!\")\nelif temperature \nLoops (For & While loop)\nLoops are another important feature of any programming language.

In this case, the loop checks if x is less than 9 each time the loop passes.\nx = 0\nwhile x \nFunctions\nFunctions are blocks of code that are referred to by name. Data can be passed into it to be operated on (i.e. the parameters) and can optionally return data (the return value). All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed.\nThe function below takes two numbers and adds them together, outputting the result.\ndef add(number1, number2):\n    return number1 + number2\n\nadd(1, 2) # expect a result of 3\n\nThe next function takes an input name and returns a string containing a welcome phrase.\ndef welcome(name):\n    welcome_phrase = \"Hello, \" + name + \"!\"\n    print(welcome_phrase)\n\nwelcome(\"Alex\") # expect \"Hello, Alex!\"\n\nData Structures\nPython has a number of different data structures for storing and manipulating variables. The main difference (regarding data structures) between C and Python is that Python manages memory for you. This means there’s no need to declare the sizes of lists, dictionaries, strings, etc.\nLists\nA data structure that holds an ordered collection (sequence) of items.\nnetworks = ['lora', 'sigfox', 'wifi', 'bluetooth', 'lte-m']\nprint(networks[2]) # expect 'wifi'\n\nDictionaries\nA dictionary is like an address-book where you can find the address or contact details of a person by knowing only his/her name, i.e. keys (names) are associate with values (details).\naddress_book = {'Alex':'2604 Crosswind Drive','Joe':'1301 Hillview Drive','Chris':'3236 Goldleaf Lane'}\nprint(address_book['Alex']) # expect '2604 Crosswind Drive'\n\nTuple\nSimilar to lists but are immutable, i.e. you cannot modify tuples after instantiation.\npycom_devices = ('wipy', 'lopy', 'sipy', 'gpy', 'fipy')\nprint(pycom_devices[0]) # expect 'wipy'\n\nFor more Python examples, check out these tutorials.

The name of the directory you created in step 1 (RGB-Blink in this case) should be shown in the Pymakr pane like so:\n\nIf this is not the case you can press alt-ctrl-r on Windows/Linux or ctrl-alt-cmd-l on macOS, in order to reload Atom and fix the issue.\n\n\nNow that you have a project created, we need to add some files to it. A standard MicroPython project has the following structure:\n\nRGB-Blink\n|-lib\n|  |- some_library.py\n|-boot.py\n|-main.py\n\n\nboot.py This is the first script that runs on your module when it\nturns on. This is often used to connect a module to a WiFi network so that\nTelnet and FTP can be used without connecting to the WiFi AP created by the\nmodule and not cluttering up the main.py file. As a beginner you do not\nneed to use a boot.py.\n\nmain.py This script runs directly after boot.py and should contain\nthe main code you wish to run on your device.\n\nlib It is often a good idea to split out re-usable code into libraries.\nIf you want to create or use libraries created by others, you will need to\ncreate a lib directory and put the library files in this. It is important\nthat you put .py files directly into lib rather than creating a directory\ntree. By default MicroPython will not detect any libraries within\nsub-directories.\n\n\nFor this example, you will just need to create a main.py file.\nNow that the project structure is setup, you may wish to configure project specific settings for Pymakr e.g. Which serial port to use. On Atom you need to click the ^ button on the Pymakr pane, then click Project Settings. On Visual Studio Code you need to click the All commands button on the bottom of the windows, then click Pymakr > Project Settings. This creates a file called pymakr.conf inside your project and populates it with default settings copied over from your global settings. A detailed explanation of these settings can be found here.\nControlling the on-board LED\nNow that you have setup and configured your project, we can move on to programming your module. The first thing we will need to do is import some libraries in order to interact with the on-board LED. The Pycom firmware comes with a large amount of libraries for standard functionality built-in. You can find out more about these in the API documentation. For this example you will need to open the main.py file and add the following code:\nimport pycom\nimport time\n\nThis will import two libraries, Pycom which is responsible for Pycom specific features, such as the on-board LED and time which is a standard library used timing and delays.\nYou may have noticed that when you power up your Pycom module, the on-board LED blinks blue on a regular basis. This \"heartbeat\" is used as a way of know that your module has powered up and started correctly. Before we can change the colour of this LED we need to disable this heart beat. Below your imports you will need to add the following:\npycom.heartbeat(False)\n\nNow it's time to test your code. On the Pymakr pane/bottom of the window you will see a run button. (If you haven't connected to your device yet, you will need to do that first). When you click the run button, the code in the currently open file will be executed on the device, but it won't copy it to the device. After running this code, you should see that that on-board LED stops blinking blue.\nNow that we can confirm the device is connected and Pymakr is able to run code on it, we can complete our script to blink the LED like so:\nimport pycom\nimport time\n\npycom.heartbeat(False)\n\nwhile True:\n    pycom.rgbled(0xFF0000)  # Red\n    time.sleep(1)\n    pycom.rgbled(0x00FF00)  # Green\n    time.sleep(1)\n    pycom.rgbled(0x0000FF)  # Blue\n    time.sleep(1)\n\nOnce you run the above script, it will run forever. You will notice this prevents you from accessing the interactive REPL on the device (You cannot see the >>> prompt). In order to stop the script, click onto the Pymakr terminal, and press ctrl-c on your keyboard. This should stop the script running and return you to the interactive REPL.\nUploading to your module\nIn the previous section we got code running on on your Pycom module using the run feature of Pymakr. This is useful for quick testing but has a couple of drawbacks. Firstly the code does not remain on the device permanently. If you reboot the device, it will no longer be running your code. Secondly, it will only work if you are using libraries built into the firmware. If you need any extra libraries, these need to be copied to the device first. This is where the upload feature comes in. If instead of run you click upload, Pymakr will upload all the files in the project (so long as their type is in the sync_file_types setting for your project). These then persist on your device even between reboots, and allows you to use libraries from the lib folder in your project.\nIf you need to remove files from your device you have two options, either connect via FTP and manage your files that way or format the device's internal flash like so:\nimport os\nos.mkfs('/flash')\n\n"},"gettingstarted/programming/repl/":{"url":"gettingstarted/programming/repl/","title":"REPL","keywords":"","body":"REPL\nREPL stands for Read Evaluate Print Loop, and is the name given to the interactive MicroPython prompt that is accessible on the Pycom devices.

You can use the REPL in addition to writing scripts in main.py.\nThe following pages will explain how to use the REPL with both Serial USB and Telnet connections.\nThe REPL includes the following features:\n\nInput history: use arrow up and arrow down to scroll through the history\nTab completion: press tab to auto-complete variables or module names\nHalt any executing code: with Ctrl-C\nCopy/paste code or output: Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V\n\nThere are a number of useful shortcuts for interacting with the MicroPython REPL. See below for the key combinations;\n\nCtrl-A on a blank line will enter raw REPL mode.

If the keyboard does not support the \\-key (i.e. an obscure combination for \\ like ALT-SHIFT-7 is required), the key combination can be remapped for the quit command:\n\ncreate ~/.screenrc\nadd bind q to the exit command\n\nThis will allow screen to exited by pressing CTRL-A Q.\nOn Linux, picocom or minicom may be used instead of screen. The usb serial address might also be listed as /dev/ttyUSB01 or a higher increment for ttyUSB. Additionally, the elevated permissions to access the device (e.g. group uucp/dialout or use sudo) may be required.\n\nWindows\nA terminal emulator is needed to open the connection from Windows; the easiest option is to download the free program, PuTTY.\nCOM Port\nTo use PuTTY the serial port (COM port) in which the Pycom device is connected, must be located.

It is possible to alter the boot procedure of the module by tying certain pins high or low when the module boots.\nBootloader\nIf you updated your device before using it, you have already put the device into bootloader mode. This is achieved by connecting G23 to GND while the device boots. If you used a Pysense/Pytrack to update, it did this automatically for you. You only need to put your Pycom module into bootloader mode if you are updating its firmware, or are programming your own low level code. This is not required if you are updating your MicroPython code.\nSafe Boot\nSome times the code you have written will prevent you gaining access to the REPL or prevent you updating your code. Some example may be:\n\nYou disabled the WiFi/UART\nYour code gets stuck before reaching the REPL\nYou set a socket as blocking but never receive any data\n\nIn order to fix this you can safe boot your module. This will prevent boot.py and main.py from being executed and will drop you straight into the interactive REPL. After reset, if P12 pin is held high (i.e. connect it to the 3V3 output pin), the heartbeat LED will begin flashing orange slowly. If after 3 seconds the pin is still held high, the LED will start blinking faster. In this mode the module will do the same as previously explained but it will also select the previous OTA image to boot if you have updated the module via the OTA update procedure (updates performed via the firmware update tool do not count). This is useful if you flashed a OTA update that breaks the device.\nPin P12 released during:\n\n\n\n1st 3 secs window\n2nd 3 secs window\n\n\n\n\nDisable boot.py and main.py\nSame as previous but using previous OTA firmware\n\n\n\nThe selection made during safe boot is not persistent, therefore after the next normal reset, the latest firmware will proceed to run again.\nIf problems occur within the filesystem or you wish to factory reset your module to remove your code, run following code in the REPL:\n>>> import os\n>>> os.mkfs('/flash')\n\nBe aware, resetting the flash filesystem will delete all files inside the internal device storage (not the SD card) and they cannot be recovered.\n\nReset\nPycom devices support both soft and hard resets. A soft reset clears the state of the MicroPython virtual machine but leaves hardware peripherals unaffected. To do a soft reset, press Ctrl+D on the REPL or from within a script, run:\n>>> import sys\n>>> sys.exit()\n\nA hard reset is the same as performing a power cycle to the device. In order to hard reset the device, press the reset switch or run:\n>>> import machine\n>>> machine.reset()\n\n"},"gettingstarted/registration/":{"url":"gettingstarted/registration/","title":"Device Registration","keywords":"","body":"Device Registration\nSome of our devices require registration before you can utilise specific features such as certain types of networking.

The Application Key is the shared secret (between the end-device and the Join-Server) which forms the basis for LoRaWAN security and is used to generate the application and network session keys used for privacy and message integrity.\nAt the completion of your device registration process on the Senet Developer Portal, you will be presented with the Application EUI and the Application Key which you will need to provision in your device. This information is always available after the fact in the device details screen.\n\nProvisioning the LoPy or FiPy\nAfter device registration is complete, configure the device for optimal operation and provision the AppEUI and AppKey.\nfrom network import LoRa\nimport socket\nimport time\nimport ubinascii\n\n# Initialise LoRa in LORAWAN mode.\n# Please pick the region that matches where you are using the device:\n# Asia = LoRa.AS923\n# Australia = LoRa.AU915\n# Europe = LoRa.EU868\n# United States = LoRa.US915\nlora = LoRa(mode=LoRa.LORAWAN, region=LoRa.US915)\n\n# create an OTAA authentication parameters\napp_eui = ubinascii.unhexlify('00250C0000010001')\napp_key = ubinascii.unhexlify('00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF')\n\n# initialize LoRa\nlora.init(mode=LoRa.LORAWAN, adr=True, public=True)\n\n# join a network using OTAA (Over the Air Activation)\nlora.join(activation=LoRa.OTAA, auth=(app_eui, app_key), dr=0, timeout=0)\n\nYou are now ready to start sending messages from your device!

To confirm this, apm —version can be run to check which Python version apm is using.\nSolution: Tell the package manager to use python 2 instead. Running the following command switches apm to 2.7:\necho “python=/usr/bin/python2.7” >> ~/.atom/.apmrc\n\nNow reinstall Pymakr or run apm install from the Pymakr package located in ~/.atom/packages/pymakr\nCould not locate the bindings file\nIf the installation of the serialport library failed, it reverts back to the precompiled version that is included in the plugin. This is compiled for the latest versions of Atom and loses compatibility with older versions.\nSolution: upgrade to the latest Atom (1.19.0 or higher) or install the previous version of the plugin (apm install pymakr@1.0.3)\nAny error where the traceback contains .atom\\packages\\Pymakr\\ with a capital “P”\nThis happened after Pymakr renamed to pymakr (lowercase) starting at version 1.2.5, but Atom remembers the old folder name inside the packages folder.\nSolution:\n\nUninstall Pymakr\nRemove folder: ~/.atom/.apm/Pymkr\nEmpty folder: ~/.config/Atom/Cache\nReinstall pymakr\n\nCannot connect to Pycom board via REPL\nIn the case of a board that has already has code uploaded to it and is running a loop/non-exiting script, the board may not boot into a REPL.\nSolution: If the board is currently running code, you will need to exit the current script before proceeding: 1. Ensure your board is connected to your computer 2. Press the reset button on the device 3. Press ctrl-c on within the Pymakr console to exit the current script/program\nThe REPL should then appear with the >>> prompt and you will be able to run/sync your code.\nCannot connect to Pycom on Linux\nIf you’re a Linux user and can’t connect to your board, there might be a permission issue to access the serial port.\nSolution: Run the following command sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER\nVSCode\nTerminal not opening\nIf the Pymakr terminal is not opening or giving an error, this might be because NodeJS is not installed on your system. This is because the terminal process is running separate from VSCode and depends on your systems NodeJS install.\nSolution: install NodeJS.

If you are using an\nExpansion Board, and have just finished a firmware upgrade, be sure to Remove\nthe wire between GND and G23 and reset your device by pressing the button.\n\nOpen Visual Studio Code and ensure that the Pymakr Plugin has correctly installed.\n\n\n\n\nClick All commands on the bottom of the Visual Studio Code window\n\n\n\nIn the list that appears, click Pymakr > Extra > List Serial Ports\n\n\n\nThis will list the available serial ports. If Pymakr is able to auto-detect which to use, this will be copied to your clipboard. If not please manually copy the correct serial port.\n\n\n\nOnce again click All commands, then click Pymakr > Global Settings. This will open a JSON file. Paste the serial address you copied earlier into the field address and save the file.\n\n\n\nFinally close the JSON file, click All commands, then Pymakr > Connect to connect your device. The Pymakr console should show three arrows >>>, indicating that you are connected\n\n\nThese settings can also be applied on a per project basis by clicking All commands then Pymakr > Project Settings. This will open a JSON file which you can edit to enter your desired settings for the currently open project.\nThis process is easiest with either a Pycom Expansion Board or a Pytrack/Pysense as the addresses are automatically selected. For external products such as FTDI USB Serial Cables, the serial address may need to be copied manually. Additionally, the reset button on the device may also need to be pressed before a connection message appears.\n\nConnecting via Telnet\nAfter installing the Pymakr Plugin, a device may be connected via the telnet interface. Please see the following steps:\n\nEnsure that Pycom device is turned on\nConnect the host computer to the WiFi Access Point named after your board\n(the SSID will be as follows e.g. lopy-wlan-xxxx, wipy-wlan-xxxx, etc.).\nThe password is www.pycom.io.\n\nFollow the steps as above in the \"Connecting via Serial USB\" section but\nenter 192.168.4.1 as the address.\n\nThe default username and password are micro and python,\nrespectively.\n\nFinally close the JSON file, click All commands, then Pymakr > Connect,\nPymakr will now connect via telnet.\n\n\n"},"pymakr/toolsfeatures.html":{"url":"pymakr/toolsfeatures.html","title":"Tools/Features","keywords":"","body":"Tools/Features\nConsole (REPL)\nMicroPython has an interactive code tool known as the REPL (Read Evaluate Print Line). The REPL allows you to run code on your device, line by line. To begin coding, go to the Pymakr Plugin Console and start typing your code. Start by making the LED change colour.\nimport pycom           # we need this module to control the LED\n\npycom.heartbeat(False) # disable the blue blinking\npycom.rgbled(0x00ff00) # make the LED light up green in colour\n\nYou can change the colour by adjusting the hex RGB value.\npycom.rgbled(0xff0000) # now make the LED light up red in colour\n\nThe console can be used to run any python code, also functions or loops.\nUse print() to output contents of variables to the console for you to read. Returned values from functions will also be displayed if they are not caught in a variable. This will not happen for code running from the main or boot files. Here you need to use print() to output to the console.\nNote that after writing or pasting any indented code like a function or a while loop, the user will have to press enter up to three times to tell MicroPython the code is to be closed (this is standard MicroPython & Python behaviour).\nAlso be aware that code written into the REPL is not saved after the device is powered off/on again.\n\nRun\nTo test code on a device, create a new .py file or open an existing one, type the desired code, save the file and then press the Run button. This will run the code directly onto the Pycom board and output the results of the script to the REPL.\nChanges made to files won’t be automatically uploaded to the board upon restarting or exiting the Run feature, as the Pycom board will not store this code. In order to push the code permanently to a device, use the Upload feature.\n\nProjects\nPymakr Plugin supports user projects, allowing for pre-configured settings such as default serial address/credentials, files to be ignored and folders to sync.\npymakr.conf\nPymakr Plugin supports local project settings using a file called pymakr.conf. This can be used to store the default serial address of a device, which files to ignore and other settings. An example pymakr.conf is shown below:\n{\n    \"address\": \"/dev/cu.usbserial-AB001234\",\n    \"username\": \"micro\",\n    \"password\": \"python\",\n    \"sync_folder\": \"scripts\"\n}\n\nUpload\nThe Pymakr Plugins have a feature to sync and upload code to a device. This can be used for both uploading code to a device as well as testing out scripts by running them live on the device. The following steps demonstrate how to use this feature.\nTo start using the Upload feature, ensure that a project folder has been created for the device. For example, if using the pymakr.conf from above, this project folder should be named scripts. This folder should have the following structure:\n\nLibrary files should be placed into the lib folder, certificates into the cert folder and so on. The Upload button will take the highest level folder (currently open) and upload this to the connected Pycom device. The files will be pushed to the device in exactly the same structure as within the code editor's file directory.\nMore\nClicking the More button within the Pymakr Plugin allows for some additional features. See the options below for specific functionality.\nGet Firmware Version\nRetrieves the firmware version of the Pycom device connected to the Pymakr Plugin instance.\nGet WiFi AP SSID\nRetrieves the default WiFi Access Point SSID of the Pycom device connected to the Pymakr Plugin instance.\nGet Serial Ports\nRetrieves the various serial ports that are available to the Pymakr Plugin instance.\n"},"pymakr/settings.html":{"url":"pymakr/settings.html","title":"Settings","keywords":"","body":"Settings\nBelow you will find a description of the various settings available for Pymakr.\naddress\nThis is the address of the Pycom module you want Pymakr can connect to.

Both Pytrack and Pysense have the same methods, although the appropriate class, either pytrack or pysense, has to be instantiated.\nQuick Usage Example\nThe following example is also available at Sleep Wakeup Example Libraries GitHub repository\n#from pytrack import Pytrack\nfrom pysense import Pysense\nfrom LIS2HH12 import LIS2HH12\nimport time\n\n#py = Pytrack()\npy = Pysense()\n\n# display the reset reason code and the sleep remaining in seconds\n# possible values of wakeup reason are:\n# WAKE_REASON_ACCELEROMETER = 1\n# WAKE_REASON_PUSH_BUTTON = 2\n# WAKE_REASON_TIMER = 4\n# WAKE_REASON_INT_PIN = 8\n\nprint(\"Wakeup reason: \" + str(py.get_wake_reason()))\nprint(\"Approximate sleep remaining: \" + str(py.get_sleep_remaining()) + \" sec\")\ntime.sleep(0.5)\n\n# enable wakeup source from INT pin\npy.setup_int_pin_wake_up(False)\n\nacc = LIS2HH12()\n\n# enable activity and also inactivity interrupts, using the default callback handler\npy.setup_int_wake_up(True, True)\n\n# set the acceleration threshold to 2000mG (2G) and the min duration to 200ms\nacc.enable_activity_interrupt(2000, 200)\n\n# go to sleep for 5 minutes maximum if no accelerometer interrupt happens\npy.setup_sleep(300)\npy.go_to_sleep()\n\nMethods\npytrack.get_sleep_remaining()\nIn the event of a sleep session that was awoken by an asynchronous event (Accelerometer, INT pin or Reset button) the approximate sleep remaining interval (expressed in seconds) can be found out. The user has to manually use setup_sleep() to configure the next sleep interval.\npytrack.get_wake_reason()\nReturns the last wakeup reason. Possible values are:\n# WAKE_REASON_ACCELEROMETER = 1 # Accelerometer activity/inactivity detection\n# WAKE_REASON_PUSH_BUTTON = 2   # Pytrack/Pysense reset buttom\n# WAKE_REASON_TIMER = 4         # Normal timeout of the sleep interval\n# WAKE_REASON_INT_PIN = 8       # INT pin\n\nNote: the WAKE_REASON_INT_PIN can be used if the PIC_RC1 pin (pin#6 on External IO Header) is toggled.\nAs in the above example, this method should be called at the beginning of the script, to find out the reset (wakeup) reason.\npytrack.go_to_sleep([gps=True])\nPuts the board in sleep mode, for the duration, which has to be set previously with pytrack.setup_sleep(timout_sec). The optional boolean parameter sets the GPS state during sleep.\nMicroPython code, which is after this function, is not executed, as wakeup will restart MicroPython.\npytrack.setup_int_wake_up(rising, falling])\nEnables as wakeup source, the accelerometer INT pin (PIC - RA5). The boolean parameters will indicate rising edge (activity detection) and/or falling edge (inactivity detection) is configured.\nThe accelerometer (class LIS2HH12) has to be also configured for a certain acceleration threshold and duration. Code snippet:\nfrom pytrack import Pytrack\nfrom LIS2HH12 import LIS2HH12\n\npy = Pytrack()\nacc = LIS2HH12()\n\n# enable activity and also inactivity interrupts, using the default callback handler\npy.setup_int_wake_up(True, True)\n\n# set the acceleration threshold to 2000mG (2G) and the min duration to 200ms\nacc.enable_activity_interrupt(2000, 200)\n\npytrack.setup_int_pin_wake_up([rising_edge = True])\nEnables as wakeup source, the INT pic (PIC - RC1, pin#6 on External IO Header). Either rising or falling edge has to be set, by default it's rising edge.\npytrack.setup_sleep(time_seconds)\nSets the sleep interval, specified in seconds. The actual sleep will be started by calling go_to_sleep() method.\nWarning: When running via the repl calling setup_sleep() will hang/crash the repl. this is not the case for scripts uploaded to the board.\nPlease note that more functionality is being added weekly to these libraries.

Note down the reading in millivolts, e.g. 1120. To disconnect the 1.1v reference from P22 please reset your module. You can now calibrate the ADC by telling it the true value of the internal reference. You should then check your calibration by connecting the ADC to a known voltage source.\n# Set calibration - see note above\nadc.vref(1100)\n\n# Check calibration by reading a known voltage\nadc_c = adc.channel(pin='P16', attn=ADC.ATTN_11DB)\nprint(adc_c.voltage())\n\n"},"tutorials/all/i2c.html":{"url":"tutorials/all/i2c.html","title":"I2C","keywords":"","body":"I2C\nThe following example receives data from a light sensor using I2C.

The pycom library provides several functions to achieve this. This example will demonstrate how you could potentially use this functionality to update deployed devices. The full source code of this example can be found here.\nMethod\nHere we will describe one possible update methodology you could use that is implemented by this example.\nImagine you a smart metering company and you wish to roll out an update for your Pycom based smart meter. These meters usually send data back via LoRa. Unfortunately LoRa downlink messages have a very limited size and several hundred if not thousand would be required to upload a complete firmware image. To get around this you can have your devices sending their regular data via LoRa and when they receive a special command via a downlink message, the devices will connect to a WiFi network. It is unfeasible to ask customers to allow your device to connect to their home network so instead this network could be provided by a vehicle. This vehicle will travel around a certain geographic area in which the devices have been sent the special downlink message to initiate the update. The devices will look for the WiFi network being broadcast by the vehicle and connect. The devices will then connect to a server running on this WiFi network. This server (also shown in this example) will generate manifest files that instruct the device on what it should update, and where to get the update data from.\nServer\nCode available here.\nThis script runs a HTTP server on port 8000 that provisions over the air (OTA) update manifests in JSON format as well as serving the update content. This script should be run in a directory that contains every version of the end devices code, in the following structure:\n  - server directory\n    |- this_script.py\n    |- 1.0.0\n    |  |- flash\n    |  |   |- lib\n    |  |   |  |- lib_a.py\n    |  |   |- main.py\n    |  |   |- boot.py\n    |  |- sd\n    |     |- some_asset.txt\n    |     |- asset_that_will_be_removed.wav\n    |- 1.0.1\n    |  |- flash\n    |  |   |- lib\n    |  |   |  |- lib_a.py\n    |  |   |  |- new_lib.py\n    |  |   |- main.py\n    |  |   |- boot.py\n    |  |- sd\n    |     |- some_asset.txt\n    |- firmware_1.0.0.bin\n    |- firmware_1.0.1.bin\n\nThe top level directory that contains this script can contain one of two things:\n\nUpdate directory: These should be named with a version number compatible\nwith the python LooseVersion versioning scheme\n(http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/stdlib/distutils.version.LooseVersion-class.html).\nThey should contain the entire file system of the end device for the\ncorresponding version number.\n\nFirmware: These files should be named in the format firmare_VERSION.bin, where VERSION is a a version number compatible with the python LooseVersion versioning scheme (http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/stdlib/distutils.version.LooseVersion-class.html).\nThis file should be in the format of the appimg.bin created by the Pycom\nfirmware build scripts.\n\n\nHow to use\nOnce the directory has been setup as described above you simply need to start this script using python3. Once started this script will run a HTTP server on port 8000 (this can be changed by changing the PORT variable). This server will serve all the files in directory as expected along with one additional special file, manifest.json. This file does not exist on the file system but is instead generated when requested and contains the required changes to bring the end device from its current version to the latest available version. You can see an example of this by pointing your web browser at:\nhttp://127.0.0.1:8000/manifest.json?current_ver=1.0.0\nThe current_ver field at the end of the URL should be set to the current firmware version of the end device. The generated manifest will contain lists of which files are new, have changed or need to be deleted along with SHA1 hashes of the files. Below is an example of what such a manifest might look like:\n{\n   \"delete\": [\n      \"flash/old_file.py\",\n      \"flash/other_old_file.py\"\n   ],\n   \"firmware\": {\n       \"URL\": \"http://192.168.1.144:8000/firmware_1.0.1b.bin\",\n       \"hash\": \"ccc6914a457eb4af8855ec02f6909316526bdd08\"\n   },\n   \"new\": [\n       {\n           \"URL\": \"http://192.168.1.144:8000/1.0.1b/flash/lib/new_lib.py\",\n           \"dst_path\": \"flash/lib/new_lib.py\",\n           \"hash\": \"1095df8213aac2983efd68dba9420c8efc9c7c4a\"\n       }\n   ],\n   \"update\": [\n       {\n           \"URL\": \"http://192.168.1.144:8000/1.0.1b/flash/changed_file.py\",\n           \"dst_path\": \"flash/changed_file.py\",\n           \"hash\": \"1095df8213aac2983efd68dba9420c8efc9c7c4a\"\n       }\n   ],\n   \"version\": \"1.0.1b\"\n}\n\nThe manifest contains the following fields:\n\ndelete: A list of paths to files which are no longer needed\nfirmware: The URL and SHA1 hash of the firmware image\nnew: the URL, path on end device and SHA1 hash of all new files\nupdate: the URL, path on end device and SHA1 hash of all files which\nexisted before but have changed.\n\nversion: The version number that this manifest will update the client to\n\nprevious_version: The version the client is currently on before applying\nthis update\n\n\nNote: The version number of the files might not be the same as the firmware. The highest available version number, higher than the current client version is used for both firmware and files. This may differ between the two.\nIn order for the URL's to be properly formatted you are required to send a \"host\" header along with your HTTP get request e.g:\nGET /manifest.json?current_ver=1.0.0 HTTP/1.0\\r\\nHost: 192.168.1.144:8000\\r\\n\\r\\n\n\nClient Library\nA MicroPyton library for interfacing with the server described above is available here.\nThis library is split into two layers. The top level OTA class implements all the high level functionality such as parsing the JSON file, making back copies of files being updated incase the update fails, etc. The layer of the library is agnostic to your chosen transport method. Below this is the WiFiOTA class. This class implements the actual transport mechanism of how the device fetches the files and update manifest (via WiFi as the class name suggests). The reason for this split is so that the high level functionality can be reused regardless of what transport mechanism you end up using. This could be implemented on top of Bluetooth for example, or the sever changed from HTTP to FTP.\nAlthough the above code is functional, it is provided only as an example of how an end user might implement a OTA update mechanism. It is not 100% feature complete e.g. even though it does backup previous versions of files, the roll back procedure is not implemented. This is left of the end user to do.\n\nExample\nBelow is am example implementing the methodology previously explained in this tutorial to initiate an OTA update.\nThe example below will only work on a Pycom device with LoRa capabilities.

This technology offers long range, low power, secure communications, however, at much lower data rates than traditional networks such as Wi-Fi. In this tutorial we show how to perform a fast, reliable, over-the-air (OTA) update of the text files (.py, .js, .txt, etc) residing in flash.\nGetting Started\nThis project is based on a client-server architecture. On the server side the loraserver and the mosquitto MQTT server are used to send data between the updater application and the connected devices. The updater interfaces with the loraserver MQTT using the [paho-mqtt] (https://pypi.org/project/paho-mqtt/) client. The Python libraries and sample code for the OTA updater are available at the following Github Repository.\nServer setup\n\nInstall the loraserver. In this tutorial we will install the docker version on Linux.\nNavigate to the loraserver-docker/configuration/loraserver folder and open the loraserver.toml file. Update the following LoraWAN regional parameters as indicated:\nname=\"Your region\" E.g \"EU_863_870\" for Europe \nrx_window=2\nrx2_dr=\"Choose one with a payload of 200 bytes or more\" E.g 5 for Europe\nAn example configuration file with parameter description can be found here. The lora-app-server, lora-gateway-bridge and lora-geo-server configuration files can be left to their default values.\n\nRun the following command to create all docker containers and start the loraserver:\n$ sudo docker-compose up\n\nOpen a web-browser and use http://localhost:8080 (https if certificates configured) to access the Loraserver web-interface. \n\nLogin to loraserver using admin for both user and password.\n\n\nNow you should be able to see the Loraserver web-interface shown below.\n\n\nClick on Network-servers and press Add. Enter a network-server name and loraserver:8000 as network-server server.\n\n\nClick on the Gateway-profiles and press create. Give this profile a name, select the channels enabled for this channel, and choose the network-server just created.\n\n\nClick on the Gateways and press create. Choose a gateway name a fill the description field. Read the gateway ID from your lora gateway and choose the network-server and gateway-profile just created. Check the gateway discovery enabled checkbox.\n\n\nClick on service-profile and then press create. Choose a service-profile name, select the network-server we created before and click the Add gateway meta-data checkbox.\n\n\nClick on Device-profile and then press the create button. In the general tab, input a device-profile name, select 1.0.2 from the Lorawan Mac version menu and select B from the Lorawan Regional parameters revision field.\n\nIn the Join tab, select the Device supports OTAA check box otherwise ABP will be chosen automatically. If you prefer ABP, you need to fill the RX1 delay, RX2 data-rate and RX2 channel frequency parameters.\n\nIn the class C tab, please select Device supports Class-C checkbox. \n\nClick on Applications and then press create. Input an application name and an application description. From the dropdown menu choose the service-profile we created previoulsy.\n\nClick on the application just created and in the devices tab, select create. Select a device name, device description and a device EUI. From the device-profile dropdown menu select the device-profile create in the previous steps.\n\nIn the keys tab, generate the application keys. \n\n\nThe server side code requires Python 3. To determine whether you have Python 3 installed, type the following:\n$ python3 -V\n\nInstall the paho mqtt client using:\n$ pip3 install paho-mqtt\n\nClone or download the OTA updater from the following Github Repository.\nThe server scripts should be run in a directory that contains every version of the end devices code, in the following structure:\n- server directory\n  |- server OTA python scripts\n  |- 1.0.0 (client code)\n  |  |- flash\n  |  |   |- lib\n  |  |   |- other text / scripts\n  |  |   |- main.py\n  |  |   |- boot.py\n  |- 1.0.1 (client code)\n  |  |- flash\n  |  |   |- lib\n  |  |   |- main.py\n  |  |   |- boot.py\n  |  |   |- other text / scripts\n  |  |   |- new scripts.py\n\n\n Update the python config file parameters with the values from the previous steps.  \n\nStart the OTA updater service using the following:\n$ python3 updaterService.py\n\n\nClient setup\nA MicroPyton library for interfacing with the server described above is available here.\n\nOpen the main.py and set the Lorawan regional parameters to be exactly the same as those on the gateway and Loraserver.

However, MicroPython is highly configurable, and each port to a particular board/embedded system makes available only a subset of MicroPython libraries. For officially supported ports, there is an effort to either filter out non-applicable items, or mark individual descriptions with “Availability:” clauses describing which ports provide a given feature. With that in mind, please still be warned that some functions/classes in a module (or even the entire module) described in this documentation may be unavailable in a particular build of MicroPython on a particular board. The best place to find general information of the availability/non-availability of a particular feature is the “General Information” section which contains information pertaining to a specific port.\nBeyond the built-in libraries described in this documentation, many more modules from the Python standard library, as well as further MicroPython extensions to it, can be found in the micropython-lib repository.\n"},"firmwareapi/pycom/":{"url":"firmwareapi/pycom/","title":"Pycom Modules","keywords":"","body":"Pycom Modules\nThese modules are specific to the Pycom devices and may have slightly different implementations to other variations of MicroPython (i.e. for Non-Pycom devices).

See constants for the possible return values.\nInterrupt Functions\nmachine.disable_irq()\nDisable interrupt requests. Returns and integer representing the previous IRQ state. This return value can be passed to enable_irq to restore the IRQ to its original state.\nmachine.enable_irq([state])\nEnable interrupt requests. The most common use of this function is to pass the value returned by disable_irq to exit a critical section. Another options is to enable all interrupts which can be achieved by calling the function with no parameters.\nPower Functions\nmachine.freq()\nReturns CPU frequency in hertz.\nmachine.idle()\nGates the clock to the CPU, useful to reduce power consumption at any time during short or long periods. Peripherals continue working and execution resumes as soon as any interrupt is triggered (on many ports this includes system timer interrupt occurring at regular intervals on the order of millisecond).\nmachine.deepsleep([time_ms])\nStops the CPU and all peripherals, including the networking interfaces (except for LTE). Execution is resumed from the main script, just as with a reset. If a value in milliseconds is given then the device will wake up after that period of time, otherwise it will remain in deep sleep until the reset button is pressed.\nThe products with LTE connectivity (FiPy, GPy, G01), require the LTE radio to be disabled separately via the LTE class before entering deepsleep. This is required due to the LTE radio being powered independently and allowing use cases which require the system to be taken out from deepsleep by an event from the LTE network (data or SMS received for instance).\nmachine.pin_deepsleep_wakeup(pins, mode, enable_pull)\nConfigure pins to wake up from deep sleep mode. The pins which have this capability are: P2, P3, P4, P6, P8 to P10 and P13 to P23.\nThe arguments are:\n\npins a list or tuple containing the GPIO to setup for deepsleep wakeup.\nmode selects the way the configure GPIOs can wake up the module. The possible values are: machine.WAKEUP_ALL_LOW and machine.WAKEUP_ANY_HIGH.\nenable_pull if set to True keeps the pull up or pull down resistors enabled during deep sleep. If this variable is set to True, then ULP or capacitive touch wakeup cannot be used in combination with GPIO wakeup.\n\nmachine.wake_reason()\nGet the wake reason. See constants for the possible return values. Returns a tuple of the form: (wake_reason, gpio_list). When the wakeup reason is either GPIO or touch pad, then the second element of the tuple is a list with GPIOs that generated the wakeup.\nmachine.remaining_sleep_time()\nReturns the remaining timer duration (in milliseconds) if the ESP32 is woken up from deep sleep by something other than the timer. For example, if you set the timer for 30 seconds (30000 ms) and it wakes up after 10 seconds then this function will return 20000.\nMiscellaneous Functions\nmachine.main(filename)\nSet the filename of the main script to run after boot.py is finished. If this function is not called then the default file main.py will be executed.\nIt only makes sense to call this function from within boot.py.\nmachine.rng()\nReturn a 24-bit software generated random number.\nmachine.unique_id()\nReturns a byte string with a unique identifier of a board/SoC. It will vary from a board/SoC instance to another, if underlying hardware allows. Length varies by hardware (so use substring of a full value if you expect a short ID). In some MicroPython ports, ID corresponds to the network MAC address.\nUse ubinascii.hexlify() to convert the byte string to hexadecimal form for ease of manipulation and use elsewhere.\n\nmachine.info()\nReturns the high water mark of the stack associated with various system tasks, in words (1 word = 4 bytes on the ESP32). If the value is zero then the task has likely overflowed its stack. If the value is close to zero then the task has come close to overflowing its stack.\nConstants\nReset Causes\nmachine.PWRON_RESET, machine.HARD_RESET, machine.WDT_RESET, machine.DEEPSLEEP_RESET, machine.SOFT_RESET, machine.BROWN_OUT_RESET\nWake Reasons\nmachine.PWRON_WAKE, machine.PIN_WAKE, machine.RTC_WAKE, machine.ULP_WAKE\nPin Wakeup Modes\nmachine.WAKEUP_ALL_LOW, machine.WAKEUP_ANY_HIGH\n"},"firmwareapi/pycom/machine/adc.html":{"url":"firmwareapi/pycom/machine/adc.html","title":"ADC","keywords":"ADC Analog ADCChannel","body":"ADC\nclass ADC – Analog to Digital Conversion\nQuick Usage Example\nimport machine\n\nadc = machine.ADC()             # create an ADC object\napin = adc.channel(pin='P16')   # create an analog pin on P16\nval = apin()                    # read an analog value\n\nConstructors\nclass machine.ADC(id=0)\nCreate an ADC object; associate a channel with a pin.

A device responds if it pulls the SDA line low after its address (including a read bit) is sent on the bus.\nStandard Bus Operations\nThe following methods implement the standard I2C master read and write operations that target a given slave device.\ni2c.readfrom(addr, nbytes)\nRead nbytes from the slave specified by addr. Returns a bytes object with the data read.\ni2c.readfrom_into(addr, buf)\nRead into buf from the slave specified by addr. The number of bytes read will be the length of buf.\nReturn value is the number of bytes read.\ni2c.writeto(addr, buf, * , stop=True)\nWrite the bytes from buf to the slave specified by addr. The argument buf can also be an integer which will be treated as a single byte. If stop is set to False then the stop condition won’t be sent and the I2C operation may be continued (typically with a read transaction).\nReturn value is the number of bytes written.\nMemory Operations\nSome I2C devices act as a memory device (or set of registers) that can be read from and written to. In this case there are two addresses associated with an I2C transaction: the slave address and the memory address. The following methods are convenience functions to communicate with such devices.\ni2c.readfrom_mem(addr, memaddr, nbytes, *, addrsize=8)\nRead nbytes from the slave specified by addr starting from the memory address specified by memaddr. The addrsize argument is specified in bits and it can only take 8 or 16.\ni2c.readfrom_mem_into(addr, memaddr, buf, *, addrsize=8)\nRead into buf from the slave specified by addr starting from the memory address specified by memaddr. The number of bytes read is the length of buf. The addrsize argument is specified in bits and it can only take 8 or 16.\nThe return value is the number of bytes read.\ni2c.writeto_mem(addr, memaddr, buf *, addrsize=8)\nWrite buf to the slave specified by addr starting from the memory address specified by memaddr. The argument buf can also be an integer which will be treated as a single byte. The addrsize argument is specified in bits and it can only take 8 or 16.\nThe return value is the number of bytes written.\nConstants\n\nI2C.MASTER: Used to initialise the bus to master mode.\n\n"},"firmwareapi/pycom/machine/pin.html":{"url":"firmwareapi/pycom/machine/pin.html","title":"Pin","keywords":"","body":"Pin\nA pin is the basic object to control I/O pins (also known as GPIO - general-purpose input/output). It has methods to set the mode of the pin (input, output, etc) and methods to get and set the digital logic level. For analog control of a pin, see the ADC class.\nQuick Usage Example\nfrom machine import Pin\n\n# initialize `P9` in gpio mode and make it an output\np_out = Pin('P9', mode=Pin.OUT)\np_out.value(1)\np_out.value(0)\np_out.toggle()\np_out(True)\n\n# make `P10` an input with the pull-up enabled\np_in = Pin('P10', mode=Pin.IN, pull=Pin.PULL_UP)\np_in() # get value, 0 or 1\n\nConstructors\nclass machine.Pin(id, ...)\nCreate a new Pin object associated with the string id.

If it converts to True, the pin is set high, otherwise it is set low.\n\npin([value])\nPin objects are callable. The call method provides a (fast) shortcut to set and get the value of the pin.\nExample:\nfrom machine import Pin\npin = Pin('P12', mode=Pin.IN, pull=Pin.PULL_UP)\npin()   # fast method to get the value\n\nSee pin.value() for more details.\npin.toggle()\nToggle the value of the pin.\npin.mode([mode])\nGet or set the pin mode.\npin.pull([pull])\nGet or set the pin pull.\npin.hold([hold])\nGet or set the pin hold. You can apply a hold to a pin by passing True (or clear it by passing False). When a pin is held, its value cannot be changed by using Pin.value() or Pin.toggle() until the hold is released. This Can be used to retain the pin state through a core reset and system reset triggered by watchdog time-out or Deep-sleep events. Only pins in the RTC power domain can retain their value through deep sleep or reset.\nThese are: P2, P3, P4, P6, P8, P9, P10, P13, P14, P15, P16, P17, P18, P19, P20, P21, P22, P23\npin.callback(trigger, handler=None, arg=None)\nSet a callback to be triggered when the input level at the pin changes.\n\ntrigger is the type of event that triggers the callback. Possible values are:\nPin.IRQ_FALLING interrupt on falling edge.\nPin.IRQ_RISING interrupt on rising edge.\nPin.IRQ_LOW_LEVEL interrupt on low level.\nPin.IRQ_HIGH_LEVEL interrupt on high level.\n\n\n\nThe values can be OR-ed together, for instance trigger=Pin.IRQ_FALLING | Pin.IRQ_RISING\n\nhandler is the function to be called when the event happens. This function will receive one argument. Set handler to None to disable it.\narg is an optional argument to pass to the callback. If left empty or set to None, the function will receive the Pin object that triggered it.\n\nExample:\nfrom machine import Pin\n\ndef pin_handler(arg):\n    print(\"got an interrupt in pin %s\" % (arg.id()))\n\np_in = Pin('P10', mode=Pin.IN, pull=Pin.PULL_UP)\np_in.callback(Pin.IRQ_FALLING | Pin.IRQ_RISING, pin_handler)\n\nFor more information on how Pycom’s products handle interrupts, see here.\n\nAttributes\nclass pin.exp_board\nContains all Pin objects supported by the expansion board.

Possible values are:\nCAN.RX_FRAME interrupt whenever a new frame is received.\nCAN.RX_FIFO_NOT_EMPTY interrupt when a frame is received on an empty FIFO.\nCAN.RX_FIFO_OVERRUN interrupt when a message is received and the FIFO is full.\n\n\n\nThe values can be OR-ed together, for instance trigger=CAN.RX_FRAME | CAN.RX_FIFO_OVERRUN\n\nhandler is the function to be called when the event happens. This function will receive one argument. Set handler to None to disable the callback.\narg is an optional argument to pass to the callback. If left empty or set to None, the function will receive the CAN object that triggered it.\n\nIt can be used like this:\nfrom machine import CAN\n\ncan = CAN(mode=CAN.NORMAL, baudrate=500000, pins=('P22', 'P23'))\n\ndef can_cb(can_o):\n    print('CAN Rx:', can_o.recv())\n\ncan.callback(handler=can_cb, trigger=CAN.RX_FRAME)\n\ncan.events()\nThis method returns a value with bits sets (if any) indicating the events that have occurred in the bus.

The protocol is bi-directional, messages can both be sent up to and down from the Sigfox servers.\nWhen operating in RCZ2 and RCZ4 the module can only send messages on the default macro-channel (this is due to Sigfox network limitations). Therefore, the device needs to reset automatically to the default macro-channel after every 2 transmissions. However, due to FCC duty cycle limitations, there must a minimum of a 20s delay after resetting to the default macro-channel. Our API takes care of this, (and in real life applications you should not be in the need to send Sigfox messages that often), so it will wait for the necessary amount of time to make sure that the duty cycle restrictions are fulfilled.\nThis means that if you run a piece of test code like:\nfor i in range(1, 100):\n  # send something\n  s.send('Hello ' + str(i))\n\nThere will be a 20 second delay after every 2 packets.\n\nThis class provides a driver for the Sigfox network processor in the Sigfox enabled Pycom devices.\nQuick Usage Example\nfrom network import Sigfox\nimport socket\n\n# init Sigfox for RCZ1 (Europe)\nsigfox = Sigfox(mode=Sigfox.SIGFOX, rcz=Sigfox.RCZ1)\n\n# create a Sigfox socket\ns = socket.socket(socket.AF_SIGFOX, socket.SOCK_RAW)\n\n# make the socket blocking\ns.setblocking(True)\n\n# configure it as uplink only\ns.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SIGFOX, socket.SO_RX, False)\n\n# send some bytes\ns.send(bytes([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]))\n\nPlease ensure that there is an antenna connected to your device before sending/receiving Sigfox messages as in proper use (e.g. without an antenna), may damage the device.\n\nConstructors\nclass network.Sigfox(id=0, ...)\nCreate and configure a Sigfox object. See init for params of configuration. Examples:\n# configure radio for the Sigfox network, using RCZ1 (868 MHz)\nsigfox = Sigfox(mode=Sigfox.SIGFOX, rcz=Sigfox.RCZ1)\n\n# configure radio for FSK, device to device across 912 MHz\nsigfox = Sigfox(mode=Sigfox.FSK, frequency=912000000)\n\nSigfox.FSK mode is not supported on LoPy 4 and FiPy.\n\nMethods\nsigfox.init(mode=Sigfox.SIGFOX, rcz=Sigfox.RCZ1, * , frequency=None)\nSet the Sigfox radio configuration.\nThe arguments are:\n\nmode can be either Sigfox.SIGFOX or Sigfox.FSK. Sigfox.SIGFOX uses the Sigfox modulation and protocol while Sigfox.FSK allows to create point to point communication between 2 Devices using FSK modulation. Note: Sigfox.FSK mode is not supported on LoPy 4 and FiPy.\nrcz takes the following values: Sigfox.RCZ1, Sigfox.RCZ2, Sigfox.RCZ3, Sigfox.RCZ4. The rcz argument is only required if the mode is Sigfox.SIGFOX.\nfrequency sets the frequency value in FSK mode. Can take values between 863 and 928 MHz. \n\nThe SiPy comes in 2 different hardware flavours: a +14dBm Tx power version which can only work with RCZ1 and RCZ3 and a +22dBm version which works exclusively on RCZ2 and RCZ4.\n\nsigfox.mac()\nReturns a byte object with the 8-Byte MAC address of the Sigfox radio.\nsigfox.id()\nReturns a byte object with the 4-Byte bytes object with the Sigfox ID.\nsigfox.rssi()\nReturns a signed integer with indicating the signal strength value of the last received packet.\nsigfox.pac()\nReturns a byte object with the 8-Byte bytes object with the Sigfox PAC.\nTo return human-readable values you should import ubinascii and convert binary values to hexidecimal representation. For example:\nprint(ubinascii.hexlify(sigfox.mac()))\n\n\nsigfox.frequencies()\nReturns a tuple of the form: (uplink_frequency_hz, downlink_frequency_hz)\nsigfox.public_key([public])\nSets or gets the public key flag. When called passing a True value the Sigfox public key will be used to encrypt the packets. Calling it without arguments returns the state of the flag.\n# enable encrypted packets\nsigfox.public_key(True)\n\n# return state of public_key\nsigfox.public_key()\n\nConstants\n\nSigfox radio mode: sigfox.SIGFOX, sigfox.FSK .\nSIGFOX to specify usage of the Sigfox Public Network.\nFSK to specify device to device communication.\n\n\nSigfox zones: sigfox.RCZ1, sigfox.RCZ2, sigfox.RCZ3, sigfox.RCZ4\nRCZ1 to specify Europe, Oman & South Africa.\nRCZ2 for the USA, Mexico & Brazil.\nRCZ3 for Japan.\nRCZ4 for Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Colombia & Argentina.\n\n\n\nWorking with Sigfox Sockets\nSigfox sockets are created in the following way:\nimport socket\ns = socket.socket(socket.AF_SIGFOX, socket.SOCK_RAW)\n\nAnd they must be created after initialising the Sigfox network card.\nSigfox sockets support the following standard methods from the socket module:\nsocket.close()\nUse it to close an existing socket.\nsocket.send(bytes)\nIn Sigfox mode the maximum data size is 12 bytes. In FSK the maximum is 64.\n# send a Sigfox payload of bytes\ns.send(bytes([1, 2, 3]))\n\n# send a Sigfox payload containing a string\ns.send('Hello')\n\nsocket.recv(bufsize)\nThis method can be used to receive a Sigfox downlink or FSK message.\n# size of buffer should be passed for expected payload, e.g. 64 bytes\ns.recv(64)\n\nsocket.setsockopt(level, optname, value)\nSet the value of the given socket option. The needed symbolic constants are defined in the socket module (SO_* etc.). In the case of Sigfox the values are always an integer. Examples:\n# wait for a downlink after sending the uplink packet\ns.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SIGFOX, socket.SO_RX, True)\n\n# make the socket uplink only\ns.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SIGFOX, socket.SO_RX, False)\n\n# use the socket to send a Sigfox Out Of Band message\ns.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SIGFOX, socket.SO_OOB, True)\n\n# disable Out-Of-Band to use the socket normally\ns.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SIGFOX, socket.SO_OOB, False)\n\n# select the bit value when sending bit only packets\ns.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SIGFOX, socket.SO_BIT, False)\n\nSending a Sigfox packet with a single bit is achieved by sending an empty string, i.e.:\nimport socket\ns = socket.socket(socket.AF_SIGFOX, socket.SOCK_RAW)\n\n# send a 1 bit\ns.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SIGFOX, socket.SO_BIT, True)\ns.send('')\nsocket.settimeout(value)\n# set timeout for the socket, e.g. 5 seconds\ns.settimeout(5.0)\nsocket.setblocking(flag)\n# specifies if socket should be blocking based upon Boolean flag.\ns.setblocking(True)\n\nIf the socket is set to blocking, your code will be wait until the socket completes sending/receiving.\nSigfox Downlink\nA Sigfox capable Pycom devices (SiPy) can both send and receive data from the Sigfox network. To receive data, a message must first be sent up to Sigfox, requesting a downlink message. This can be done by passing a True argument into the setsockopt() method.\ns.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SIGFOX, socket.SO_RX, True)\n\nAn example of the downlink procedure can be seen below:\n# init Sigfox for RCZ1 (Europe)\nsigfox = Sigfox(mode=Sigfox.SIGFOX, rcz=Sigfox.RCZ1)\n\n# create a Sigfox socket\ns = socket.socket(socket.AF_SIGFOX, socket.SOCK_RAW)\n\n# make the socket blocking\ns.setblocking(True)\n\n# configure it as DOWNLINK specified by 'True'\ns.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SIGFOX, socket.SO_RX, True)\n\n# send some bytes and request DOWNLINK\ns.send(bytes([1, 2, 3]))\n\n# await DOWNLINK message\ns.recv(32)\n\nSigfox FSK (Device to Device)\nTo communicate between two Sigfox capable devices, it may be used in FSK mode. Two devices are required to be set to the same frequency, both using FSK.\nSigfox.FSK mode is not supported on LoPy 4 and FiPy.\n\nDevice 1:\nsigfox = Sigfox(mode=Sigfox.FSK, frequency=868000000)\n\ns = socket.socket(socket.AF_SIGFOX, socket.SOCK_RAW)\ns.setblocking(True)\n\nwhile True:\n  s.send('Device-1')\n  time.sleep(1)\n  print(s.recv(64))\n\nDevice 2:\nsigfox = Sigfox(mode=Sigfox.FSK, frequency=868000000)\n\ns = socket.socket(socket.AF_SIGFOX, socket.SOCK_RAW)\ns.setblocking(True)\n\nwhile True:\n  s.send('Device-2')\n  time.sleep(1)\n  print(s.recv(64))\n\nRemember to use the correct frequency for your region (868 MHz for Europe, 912 MHz for USA, etc.)\n\n"},"firmwareapi/pycom/network/lte.html":{"url":"firmwareapi/pycom/network/lte.html","title":"LTE","keywords":"","body":"LTE\nThe LTE class provides access to the LTE-M/NB-IoT modem on the GPy and FiPy.

After a deinit() this method can take several seconds to return waiting for the LTE modem to start-up. Optionally specify a carrier name. The available options are: verizon, at&t, standard. standard is generic for any carrier, and it's also the option used when no arguments are given.\nlte.deinit(detach=True, reset = False)\nDisables LTE modem completely. This reduces the power consumption to the minimum. Call this before entering deepsleep.\n\ndetach : detach from network.\n\nreset : reset LTE modem.\n\n\nlte.attach(*, band=None, apn=None, cid=None, type=LTE.IP, legacyattach=True)\nEnable radio functionality and attach to the LTE network authorised by the inserted SIM card. Optionally specify:\n\nband : to scan for networks. If no band (or None) is specified, all 8 bands will be scanned. The possible values for the band are: 3, 4, 5, 8, 12, 13, 20 and 28.\n\napn : Specify the APN (Access point Name).\n\ncid : connection ID, see LTE.connect(). when the ID is set here it will be remembered when doint connect so no need to specify again\n\ntype : PDP context type either LTE.IP or LTE.IPV4V6. These are options to specify PDP type ‘Packet Data protocol’ either IP [Internet Protocol] or IPV4V6 ver4,6 , that depends actually on what does the Network support.\n\nlegacyattach : When kept = True the API LTE.isattached() will return True when attached to the Network AND Network registration status is home or roaming, when flag is False, API LTE.isattached() will return True when attached to the Network only.\n\n\n\nNOTE :\nWhen carrier is specified in LTE() or LTE.init() (eg. lte = LTE(carrier=verizon)) No need to specify band, apn or type these parameters are already programmed in to the LTE modem for each carrier.\n\nlte.isattached()\nReturns True if the cellular mode is attached to the network.

Returns the raw response from the modem as a string object. IMPORTANT: If a data session is active (i.e. the modem is connected), sending the AT commands requires to pause and then resume the data session. This is all done automatically, but makes the whole request take around 2.5 seconds.\nExample:\nlte.send_at_cmd('AT+CEREG?')    # check for network registration manually (sames as lte.isattached())\n\nOptionally the response can be parsed for pretty printing:\ndef send_at_cmd_pretty(cmd):\n    response = lte.send_at_cmd(cmd).split('\\r\\n')\n    for line in response:\n        print(line)\n\nsend_at_cmd_pretty('AT!=\"showphy\"')     # get the PHY status\nsend_at_cmd_pretty('AT!=\"fsm\"')         # get the System FSM\n\n\ndelay : specify the number of milliseconds the esp32 chip will wait between sending an AT command to the modem. and reading the response.\n\nlte.imei()\nReturns a string object with the IMEI number of the LTE modem.\nlte.iccid()\nReturns a string object with the ICCID number of the SIM card.\nlte.reset()\nPerform a hardware reset on the cellular modem.

The idea behind it is similar to CPython’s ctypes modules, but the actual API is different, streamlined and optimised for small size. The basic idea of the module is to define data structure layout with about the same power as the C language allows, and the access it using familiar dot-syntax to reference sub-fields.\nModule ustruct Standard Python way to access binary data structures (doesn’t scale well to large and complex structures).\n\nDefining Structure Layout\nStructure layout is defined by a \"descriptor\" - a Python dictionary which encodes field names as keys and other properties required to access them as associated values. Currently, uctypes requires explicit specification of offsets for each field. Offset are given in bytes from a structure start.\nFollowing are encoding examples for various field types:\n\nScalar types:\n\n\"field_name\": uctypes.UINT32 | 0\n\nIn other words, value is scalar type identifier OR-ed with field offset (in bytes) from the start of the structure.\n\nRecursive structures:\n\n\"sub\": (2, {\n    \"b0\": uctypes.UINT8 | 0,\n    \"b1\": uctypes.UINT8 | 1,\n})\n\nI.e. value is a 2-tuple, first element of which is offset, and second is a structure descriptor dictionary (note: offsets in recursive descriptors are relative to a structure it defines).\n\nArrays of Primitive Types:\n\n\"arr\": (uctypes.ARRAY | 0, uctypes.UINT8 | 2),\n\nI.e. value is a 2-tuple, first element of which is ARRAY flag OR-ed with offset, and second is scalar element type OR-ed number of elements in array.\n\nArrays of Aggregate Types:\n\n\"arr2\": (uctypes.ARRAY | 0, 2, {\"b\": uctypes.UINT8 | 0}),\n\nI.e. value is a 3-tuple, first element of which is ARRAY flag OR-ed with offset, second is a number of elements in array, and third is descriptor of element type.\n\nPointer to a primitive type:\n\n\"ptr\": (uctypes.PTR | 0, uctypes.UINT8),\n\nI.e. value is a 2-tuple, first element of which is PTR flag OR-ed with offset, and second is scalar element type.\n\nPointer to an aggregate type:\n\n\"ptr2\": (uctypes.PTR | 0, {\"b\": uctypes.UINT8 | 0}),\n\nI.e. value is a 2-tuple, first element of which is PTR flag OR-ed with offset, second is descriptor of type pointed to.\n\nBitfields:\n\n\"bitf0\": uctypes.BFUINT16 | 0 | 0 \nI.e. value is type of scalar value containing given bitfield (typenames are similar to scalar types, but prefixes with \"BF\"), OR-ed with offset for scalar value containing the bitfield, and further OR-ed with values for bit offset and bit length of the bitfield within scalar value, shifted by BF_POS and BF_LEN positions, respectively. Bitfield position is counted from the least significant bit, and is the number of right-most bit of a field (in other words, it’s a number of bits a scalar needs to be shifted right to extra the bitfield).\nIn the example above, first UINT16 value will be extracted at offset 0 (this detail may be important when accessing hardware registers, where particular access size and alignment are required), and then bitfield whose rightmost bit is least-significant bit of this UINT16, and length is 8 bits, will be extracted - effectively, this will access least-significant byte of UINT16.\nNote that bitfield operations are independent of target byte endianness, in particular, example above will access least-significant byte of UINT16 in both little- and big-endian structures. But it depends on the least significant bit being numbered 0. Some targets may use different numbering in their native ABI, but uctypes always uses normalised numbering described above.\nModule Contents\nclass uctypes.struct(addr, descriptor, layout_type=NATIVE)\nInstantiate a \"foreign data structure\" object based on structure address in memory, descriptor (encoded as a dictionary), and layout type (see below).\nuctypes.LITTLE_ENDIAN\nLayout type for a little-endian packed structure. (Packed means that every field occupies exactly as many bytes as defined in the descriptor, i.e. the alignment is 1).\nuctypes.BIG_ENDIAN\nLayout type for a big-endian packed structure.\nuctypes.NATIVE\nLayout type for a native structure - with data endianness and alignment conforming to the ABI of the system on which MicroPython runs.\nuctypes.sizeof(struct)\nReturn size of data structure in bytes. Argument can be either structure class or specific instantiated structure object (or its aggregate field).\nuctypes.addressof(obj)\nReturn address of an object. Argument should be bytes, bytearray or other object supporting buffer protocol (and address of this buffer is what actually returned).\nuctypes.bytes_at(addr, size)\nCapture memory at the given address and size as bytes object. As bytes object is immutable, memory is actually duplicated and copied into bytes object, so if memory contents change later, created object retains original value.\nuctypes.bytearray_at(addr, size)\nCapture memory at the given address and size as bytearray object. Unlike bytes_at() function above, memory is captured by reference, so it can be both written too, and you will access current value at the given memory address.\nStructure Descriptors and Instantiating Structure Objects\nGiven a structure descriptor dictionary and its layout type, you can instantiate a specific structure instance at a given memory address using uctypes.struct() constructor. Memory address usually comes from following sources:\n\nPredefined address, when accessing hardware registers on a baremetal system. Lookup these addresses in datasheet for a particular MCU/SoC.\nAs a return value from a call to some FFI (Foreign Function Interface) function.\nFrom uctypes.addressof(), when you want to pass arguments to an FFI function, or alternatively, to access some data for I/O (for example, data read from a file or network socket).\n\nStructure objects\nStructure objects allow accessing individual fields using standard dot notation: my_struct.substruct1.field1. If a field is of scalar type, getting it will produce a primitive value (Python integer or float) corresponding to the value contained in a field. A scalar field can also be assigned to.\nIf a field is an array, its individual elements can be accessed with the standard subscript operator [] - both read and assigned to.\nIf a field is a pointer, it can be dereferenced using [0] syntax (corresponding to C * operator, though [0] works in C too). Subscripting a pointer with other integer values but 0 are supported too, with the same semantics as in C.\nSumming up, accessing structure fields generally follows C syntax, except for pointer dereference, when you need to use [0] operator instead of *.\nLimitations\nAccessing non-scalar fields leads to allocation of intermediate objects to represent them. This means that special care should be taken to layout a structure which needs to be accessed when memory allocation is disabled (e.g. from an interrupt). The recommendations are:\n\nAvoid nested structures. For example, instead of mcu_registers.peripheral_a.register1, define separate layout descriptors for each peripheral, to be accessed as peripheral_a.register1.\nAvoid other non-scalar data, like array. For example, instead of peripheral_a.register[0] use peripheral_a.register0.\n\nNote that these recommendations will lead to decreased readability and conciseness of layouts, so they should be used only if the need to access structure fields without allocation is anticipated (it’s even possible to define 2 parallel layouts - one for normal usage, and a restricted one to use when memory allocation is prohibited).\n"},"firmwareapi/micropython/sys.html":{"url":"firmwareapi/micropython/sys.html","title":"sys","keywords":"","body":"sys\nMethods\nsys.exit(retval=0)\nTerminate current program with a given exit code.

On systems with underlying OS (including some RTOS), an RTC may be implicit.

The value returned by these functions may wrap around at any time, so directly subtracting them is not supported. ticks_diff() should be used instead. \"old\" value should actually precede \"new\" value in time, or result is undefined. This function should not be used to measure arbitrarily long periods of time (because ticks_*() functions wrap around and usually would have short period). The expected usage pattern is implementing event polling with timeout:\n# Wait for GPIO pin to be asserted, but at most 500us\nstart = time.ticks_us()\nwhile pin.value() == 0:\n    if time.ticks_diff(start, time.ticks_us()) > 500:\n        raise TimeoutError\n\nutime.time()\nReturns the number of seconds, as an integer, since the Epoch, assuming that underlying RTC is set.

For synchronisation, simple locks (also called mutexes or binary semaphores) are provided.\nWhen a thread specific error occurs a RuntimeError exception is raised.\nQuick Usage Example\nimport _thread\nimport time\n\ndef th_func(delay, id):\n    while True:\n        time.sleep(delay)\n        print('Running thread %d' % id)\n\nfor i in range(2):\n    _thread.start_new_thread(th_func, (i + 1, i))\n\nMethods\n_thread.start_new_thread(function, args[, kwargs])\nStart a new thread and return its identifier. The thread executes the function with the argument list args (which must be a tuple). The optional kwargs argument specifies a dictionary of keyword arguments. When the function returns, the thread silently exits. When the function terminates with an unhandled exception, a stack trace is printed and then the thread exits (but other threads continue to run).\n_thread.exit()\nRaise the SystemExit exception. When not caught, this will cause the thread to exit silently.\n_thread.allocate_lock()\nReturn a new lock object. Methods of locks are described below. The lock is initially unlocked.\n_thread.get_ident()\nReturn the thread identifier of the current thread. This is a nonzero integer. Its value has no direct meaning; it is intended as a magic cookie to be used e.g. to index a dictionary of thread-specific data. Thread identifiers may be recycled when a thread exits and another thread is created.\n_thread.stack_size([size])\nReturn the thread stack size (in bytes) used when creating new threads. The optional size argument specifies the stack size to be used for subsequently created threads, and must be 0 (use platform or configured default) or a positive integer value of at least 4096 (4KiB). 4KiB is currently the minimum supported stack size value to guarantee sufficient stack space for the interpreter itself.\nObjects\n_thread.LockType\nThis is the type of lock objects.\nclass Lock\nUsed for synchronisation between threads\nMethods\nLock objects have the following methods:\nlock.acquire(waitflag=1, timeout=-1)\nWithout any optional argument, this method acquires the lock unconditionally, if necessary waiting until it is released by another thread (only one thread at a time can acquire a lock — that’s their reason for existence).\nIf the integer waitflag argument is present, the action depends on its value: if it is zero, the lock is only acquired if it can be acquired immediately without waiting, while if it is nonzero, the lock is acquired unconditionally as above.\nIf the floating-point timeout argument is present and positive, it specifies the maximum wait time in seconds before returning. A negative timeout argument specifies an unbounded wait. You cannot specify a timeout if waitflag is zero.\nThe return value is True if the lock is acquired successfully, False if not.\nlock.release()\nReleases the lock. The lock must have been acquired earlier, but not necessarily by the same thread.\nlock.locked()\nReturn the status of the lock: True if it has been acquired by some thread, False if not.\nIn addition to these methods, lock objects can also be used via the with statement, e.g.:\nimport _thread\n\na_lock = _thread.allocate_lock()\n\nwith a_lock:\n    print(\"a_lock is locked while this executes\")\n\n"},"firmwareapi/micropython/builtin.html":{"url":"firmwareapi/micropython/builtin.html","title":"Builtin","keywords":"","body":"Builtin\nAll builtin functions are described here.

For example, other ports do not allow allocating memory inside the handler or the use of sockets.\nThese limitations were raised by handling the interrupt events differently. When an interrupt happens, a message is posted into a queue, notifying a separate thread that the appropriate callback handler should be called. Such handler would receive an argument. By default it is the object associated with the event.\nThe user can do whatever is required inside of the callback, such as creating new variables, or even sending network packets. Bear in mind that interrupts are processed sequentially and thus it is ideal to keep the handlers as short as possible in order to attend all of them in the minimum time.\nCurrently, there are 2 classes that support interrupts; the Alarm and Pin classes. Both classes provide the .callback() method that enables the interrupt and registers the given handler. For more details about interrupt usage along with examples, please visit their respective sections.\nCurrently the interrupt system can queue up to 16 interrupts.\n\n"},"datasheets/introduction.html":{"url":"datasheets/introduction.html","title":"Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nThe follow pages contain all information relating to each product, for examples: pinouts, spec sheets, relevant examples and notes.\nDevelopment Modules\nOEM modules\nExpansion Boards and Shields\n"},"datasheets/development/":{"url":"datasheets/development/","title":"Development Modules","keywords":"","body":"Development Modules\nThis section contains all of the datasheets for the Pycom Development Devices.

The DC-DC switching regulator always stays in high performance mode which is used to provide the lowest possible output ripple when the modules is in use. In this mode, it draws a quiescent current of 10mA. When the regulator is put into ECO mode, the quiescent current goes down to 10uA. Unfortunately, the pin used to control this mode is out of the RTC domain, and therefore not usable during deep sleep. This causes the regulator to always stay in PWM mode, keeping its quiescent current at 10mA. Alongside this the flash chip doesn't enter power down mode because the CS pin is floating during deep sleep. This causes the flash chip to consume around 2mA of current. To work around this issue a \"deep sleep shield\" is available that attaches to the module and allows power to be cut off from the device. The device can then be re-enabled either on a timer or via pin interrupt. With the deep sleep shield the current consumption during deep sleep is between 7uA and 10uA depending on the wake sources configured.\nTutorials\nTutorials on how to the WiPy2 module can be found in the examples section of this documentation.

However, there may be some unusual features for those not used to Python documentation or that are new to the MicroPython Language. This section of the documentation aims to provide clarity for any of the design specifics that might be confusing for those new to Python and this style of documentation.\n"},"docnotes/syntax.html":{"url":"docnotes/syntax.html","title":"Syntax","keywords":"","body":"Syntax\nThe Pycom documentation follows standard Python Library format using the popular Sphinx Docs tool. There are some notable points regarding the syntax of classes, methods and constants. Please see the notes below and familiarise yourself with the specific details before reviewing the documentation.\nKeyword Arguments\nKeyword Arguments refer to the arguments that are passed into a constructor (upon referencing a class object). When passing values into a MicroPython constructor it is not always required to specify the name of the argument and instead rely on the order of the arguments passed as to describe what they refer to. In the example below, it can be seen that the argument mode is passed into the i2c.init() method without specifying a name.\nThe values of the arguments (as seen in the examples/docs) refer to the default values that are passed into the constructor if nothing is provided.\ni2c.init(mode, * , baudrate=100000, pins=(SDA, SCL))\n\nAn example of how this method might be called:\ni2c.init(I2C.MASTER, pins=('P12', 'P11'))\n\nIt can be seen that a value for baudrate was not passed into the method and thus MicroPython will assume a default value of 100000. Also the first argument mode was not specified by name, as the constructor does not require it, denoted by the lack of an = symbol in the constructor documentation.\nPassing Arguments into a Method\nIt is important to note that there are certain class methods that can only accept a keyword for certain arguments as well as some that only accept a value. This is intentional by design but is not always apparent to the user calling specific methods. The differences between the two are outlined below, with examples referencing where differences might apply and what to be aware of.\nKeyword\nAn astrik * in a method description (in the docs), denotes that the following arguments require a keyword, i.e. pin='P16' in the example below.\nadc.channel(* , pin, attn=ADC.ATTN_0DB)\n\nfrom machine import ADC\n\nadc = ADC()                     # create an ADC object\napin = adc.channel(pin='P16')   # create an analog pin on P16\n\npin is a required argument and the method channel will not execute unless it is passed as with a keyword.\nAnother example shows how the PWM class, pwm.channel() requires a keyword argument for pin but does not for id.\nfrom machine import PWM\n\npwm = PWM(0, frequency=5000)\npwm_c = pwm.channel(0, pin='P12') # no keyword argument requires for id (0) but is required for pin (pin='P12')\n\nValue\nThe documentation may refer to a method that takes an argument listed by name but does allow for a keyword to be passed. For example, the pycom class contains a method rgbled. This lists that the method accepts a value for color, however this may not be specified by keyword, only value. This is intentional as the value being passed is the only argument valid for this method\npycom.rgbled(color)\n\nIf the argument is passed into the method with a keyword, it will return an error stating TypeError: function does not take keyword arguments.\nimport pycom\n\npycom.rgbled(color=0xFF0000) # Incorrect\npycom.rgbled(0xFF0000) # Correct\n\nAnother example of a method that only accepts value input. In this case, the RTC.init() method require a value (tuple) input for the datetime. It will not accept a keyword.\nrtc.init(datetime)\n\nfrom machine import RTC\n\nrtc = RTC()\nrtc.init(datetime=(2014, 5, 1, 4, 13, 0, 0, 0)) # Incorrect\nrtc.init((2014, 5, 1, 4, 13, 0, 0, 0)) # Correct\n\nConstants\nThe constants section of a library within the docs refers to specific values from that library’s class. These might be used when constructing an object from that class or when utilising a method from within that class. These are generally listed by the library name followed by the specific value. See the example below:\nI2C.MASTER()\n\nBe aware that you can only reference these constants upon importing and constructing a object from a library.\n\n"},"docnotes/replscript.html":{"url":"docnotes/replscript.html","title":"REPL vs Scripts","keywords":"","body":"REPL vs Scripts\nUsers of this documentation should be aware that examples given in the docs are under the expectation that they are being executed using the MicroPython REPL. This means that when certain functions are called, their output may not necessarily be printed to the console if they are run from a script. When using the REPL many classes/functions automatically produce a printed output displaying the return value of the function to the console. The code snippet below demonstrates some examples of classes/functions that might display this behaviour.\nBasic Arithmetic\n1 + 1 # REPL will print out '2' to console\n1 + 1 # Script will not return anything the console\nprint(1 + 1) # Both the REPL and a script will return '2' to the console\n\nCalling Methods\nimport ubinascii\n\nubinascii.hexlify(b'12345') # REPL will print out \"b'3132333435'\" to the console\nubinascii.hexlify(b'12345') # Script will not return any the console\n\nIn order to use these functions that do not print out any values, you will need to either wrap them in a print() statement or assign them to variables and call them later when you wish to use them.\nFor example:\n# immediately print to console when using a script\nprint(1 + 1)\n# or save variable to for later\nvalue = 1 + 1\n# do something here...\nprint(value)\n\n"},"docnotes/mesh-networks.html":{"url":"docnotes/mesh-networks.html","title":"Mesh Networks","keywords":"","body":"Mesh Networks\nMesh Networking is currently under development.

Our firmware source code can be found here, along with instructions on how to build it. Below you will find specific instructions on how generate keys, build and flash encrypted firmware.\n\nObtain keys (for Secure Boot and Flash Encryption)\nFlash keys and parameters in efuses\nCompile bootloader and application with make SECURE=on\nFlash: bootloader-digest at address 0x0 and encrypted; all the others (partitions and application) encrypted, too.\n\nPrerequisites\nFirstly you will need to setup the tool chain and download the source code. detailed instructions on how to achieve this can be found here. Once you have complete this, you will need to open a terminal in the esp32 folder of the firmware source code repo.\nNext you will need keys for Flash Encryption and Secure Boot; they can be generated randomly with the following commands:\npython $IDF_PATH/components/esptool_py/esptool/espsecure.py generate_flash_encryption_key flash_encryption_key.bin\npython $IDF_PATH/components/esptool_py/esptool/espsecure.py generate_signing_key secure_boot_signing_key.pem\n\nThe Secure Boot key secure_boot_signing_key.pem has to be transformed into secure-bootloader-key.bin, to be burnt into efuses. This can be done in 2 ways:\npython $IDF_PATH/components/esptool_py/esptool/espsecure.py extract_public_key --keyfile secure_boot_signing_key.pem signature_verification_key.bin\n\nor, as an artifact of the make build process, on the same directory level as Makefile\nmake BOARD=GPY SECURE=on TARGET=boot\n\nTo flash the keys (flash_encryption_key.bin and secure-bootloader-key.bin) into the efuses (write and read protected) run the following commands (ignoring the lines that start with #):\nNote: Irreversible operations\n# Burning Encryption Key\npython $IDF_PATH/components/esptool_py/esptool/espefuse.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 burn_key flash_encryption flash_encryption_key.bin\n# Burning Secure Boot Key\npython $IDF_PATH/components/esptool_py/esptool/espefuse.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 burn_key secure_boot secure-bootloader-key.bin\n# Enabling Flash Encryption mechanism\npython $IDF_PATH/components/esptool_py/esptool/espefuse.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 burn_efuse FLASH_CRYPT_CNT\n# Configuring Flash Encryption to use all address bits together with Encryption key (max value 0x0F)\npython $IDF_PATH/components/esptool_py/esptool/espefuse.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 burn_efuse FLASH_CRYPT_CONFIG 0x0F\n# Enabling Secure Boot mechanism\npython $IDF_PATH/components/esptool_py/esptool/espefuse.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 burn_efuse ABS_DONE_0\n\nIf the keys are not written in efuse, before flashing the bootloader, then random keys will be generated by the ESP32, they can never be read nor re-written, so bootloader can never be updated. Even more, the application can be re-flashed (by USB) just 3 more times.\nMakefile options\nmake BOARD=GPY SECURE=on SECURE_KEY=secure_boot_signing_key.pem ENCRYPT_KEY=flash_encryption_key.bin TARGET=[boot|app]\n\n\nSECURE=on is the main flag; it's not optional\nif SECURE=on the following defaults are set:\nencryption is enable    \nsecure_boot_signing_key.pem is the secure boot key, located relatively to Makefile\nflash_encryption_key.bin is the flash encryption key, located relatively to Makefile\n\n\n\nFor flashing the bootloader digest and the encrypted versions of all binaries:\nmake BOARD=GPY SECURE=on flash\n\nFlashing\nFor flashing the bootloader-reflash-digest.bin has to be written at address 0x0, instead of the bootloader.bin (at address 0x1000).\nBuild is done using SECURE=on option; additionally, all the binaries are pre-encrypted.\nmake BOARD=GPY clean\nmake BOARD=GPY SECURE=on TARGET=boot\nmake BOARD=GPY SECURE=on TARGET=app\nmake BOARD=GPY SECURE=on flash\n\nManual flash command:\npython $IDF_PATH/components/esptool_py/esptool/esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 921600 --before no_reset --after no_reset write_flash -z --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 80m --flash_size detect 0x0 build/GPY/release/bootloader/bootloader-reflash-digest.bin_enc 0x8000 build/GPY/release/lib/partitions.bin_enc 0x10000 build/GPY/release/gpy.bin_enc_0x10000\n\nOTA update\nThe OTA should be done using the pre-encrypted application image.\nBecause the encryption is done based on the physical flash address, there are 2 application binaries generated:\n\ngpy.bin_enc_0x10000 which has to be written at default factory address: 0x10000\ngpy.bin_enc_0x1A0000 which has to be written at the ota_0 partition address (0x1A0000)\n\nHint: on MicroPython interface, the method pycom.ota_slot() responds with the address of the next OTA partition available (either 0x10000 or 0x1A0000).\n\n"},"documents/certificates.html":{"url":"documents/certificates.html","title":"Certificates","keywords":"","body":"Certificates\nCE RED\nDevelopment Boards\nLoPy\nLoPy CE RED Certificate\n\nWiPy 2.0\nWiPy 2.0 CE RED Certificate\n\nWiPy 3.0\nWiPy 3.0 CE RED Certificate\n\nSiPy\nSiPy CE RED Certificate\n\nGPy\nGPy CE RED Certificate\n\nFiPy\nFiPy CE RED Certificate\n\nOEM Modules\nL01\nL01 CE RED Certificate\n\nW01\nW01 CE RED Certificate\n\nG01\nG01 CE RED Certificate\n\nFCC\nDevelopment Boards\nLoPy\nLoPy FCC Certificate\n\nLoPy FCC Certificate\n\nLoPy FCC Certificate\n\nWiPy 2.0\nWiPy 2.0 FCC Certificate\n\nWiPy 2.0 FCC Certificate\n\nGPy\nGPy FCC Certificate\n\nGPy FCC Certificate\n\nGPy FCC Certificate\n\nFiPy\nFiPy FCC Certificate\n\nFiPy FCC Certificate\n\nFiPy FCC Certificate\n\nFiPy FCC Certificate\n\nOEM Modules\nL01\nL01 FCC Certificate\n\nL01 FCC Certificate\n\nL01 FCC Certificate\n\nW01\nW01 FCC Certificate\n\nW01 FCC Certificate\n\nG01\nG01 FCC Certificate\n\nG01 FCC Certificate\n\nG01 FCC Certificate\n"},"documents/license.html":{"url":"documents/license.html","title":"License","keywords":"","body":"License\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2013-2015 Damien P.
